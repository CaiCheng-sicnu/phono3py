Welcome to phono3py
=======================================================

This software calculates phonon-phonon interaction and related
properties using the supercell approach. For example, the following
physical properties are obtained:

- Lattice thermal conductivity
- Phonon lifetime/linewidth
- Imaginary part of self energy
- Joint density of states (JDOS) and weighted-JDOS

The theoretical background is summarized in the paper found at
http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.91.094306 or the draft in arxiv at
http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00691 .
